# Rulebook Node Static Data Replication
This repository contains all the necessary tools and scripts to set up a lightweight file repository for Rulebook Node static data replication. 

This project is intended for Ubuntu OS, so that static data from multiple Rulebook Nodes can be written and read by others when Nodes are down for maintenance.

> This is a convenience repository and is optional. You can set up your own SFTP server using your own processes.

We're going to go through the following steps:
- Create an instance of Ubuntu on a Cloud Service of your choice
- Update your DNS settings
- SSH onto the instance
- Hardening the Ubuntu Box
- Create an SFTP user
- Privilege the SFTP account
- Clone this repository onto the box
- Secure public read access with Let's Encrypt and a Reverse Proxy

> :warning: These instructions are for Linux based operating systems.

# Instance

1. Choose a Cloud Provider: Select a cloud provider of your choice that offers virtual machine instances. Popular options include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and DigitalOcean.

2. Provision an Instance: Create a new instance on your chosen cloud provider's platform.  as this is a static data repository, you can use one of their smallest instances.

3. Configure SSH Access: During instance creation, configure SSH access to the instance. This typically involves setting up an SSH key pair. Generate an SSH key pair if you don't already have one, and provide the public key when creating the instance. This will allow you to securely connect to the instance using SSH.

4. Set up Tunnelling: To enhance security, set up tunnelling to encrypt and secure the communication between your local machine and the instance. One common approach is to use SSH tunneling, which establishes an encrypted tunnel between your local machine and the instance.

5. Connect to the Instance: Once the instance is provisioned and SSH access is configured, you can connect to the instance using an SSH client. Use the private key associated with the SSH key pair to authenticate the SSH connection. The specific SSH command may vary depending on the cloud provider and the operating system you are using to connect.

6. Set up IPv4 and IPv6 Networking: Ensure that your instance is configured to support both IPv4 and IPv6 networking protocols. This is required by Let's Encrypt to set-up free TLS.

The specific steps and configurations may vary depending on the cloud provider and the operating system of the instance.

# DNS

Set up your DNS `A` (v4) and `AAAA` (v6) records two point at the correct IP addresses. 

We recommend using a subdomain called `static`. E.g. `static.example.com`

# Hardening the Ubuntu Box

The following instructions provide steps to harden an Ubuntu box for improved security.

## Update Package Repositories

Before proceeding with the hardening steps, ensure that your system's package repositories are up to date by running the following commands:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt update
```

## Add User

To enhance security, it is recommended to create a non-root user for regular system usage. Follow the steps below to add a new user with a name of your choosing.

```shell
sudo adduser <an unusual username>
sudo groupadd admin
sudo usermod -a -G admin <an unusual username>
```

## Restrict Root Access

It is advisable to disable direct root logins over SSH. Open the SSH server configuration file for editing:

```shell
sudo pico /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Inside the file, find the line containing `PermitRootLogin` and update it to:

```
PermitRootLogin no
```

Save the changes and exit the editor.

## Secure Shared Memory

To improve security, you can secure the shared memory by following these steps:

1. Open the `/etc/fstab` file for editing:

   ```shell
   sudo pico /etc/fstab
   ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

   ```
   tmpfs /run/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid 0 0
   ```

   This line ensures that the shared memory is mounted with specific security options.

3. Save the changes and exit the editor.

## Reboot the System

To apply the changes made during the hardening process, it is recommended to reboot the system:

```shell
sudo reboot
```

After the system restarts, the hardening configurations will be in effect.


# SFTP User Set-up

To set up an SFTP user on Ubuntu OS, follow the instructions below:

1. Open a terminal on the Ubuntu server.

2. Create a strong password and put it in the envfile for the rulebook node, `SFTP_PASSWORD`.

    ```
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```
    > Be careful not to check this into a repo by accident.  If you do, it must be changed. 

3. Run the following command to create a new user named `sftpnode`:
   ```
   sudo adduser sftpnode
   ```

4. You will be prompted to set a password for the new user.


5. Create the upload directory for the SFTP user by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /var/sftp/uploads
   ```

> N.B. When publishing static data the Rulebook Node will look for `/uploads` if it cannot write to `/`

1. Set the appropriate ownership and permissions for the `/var/sftp` directory and `/var/sftp/uploads` subdirectory by executing the following commands:
   ```
   sudo chown root:root /var/sftp
   sudo chmod 755 /var/sftp
   sudo chown sftpnode:sftpnode /var/sftp/uploads
   ```

2. Open the SSH server configuration file using a text editor. In this example, we'll use the `pico` editor, but you can use any text editor you prefer:
   ```
   sudo pico /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

3. Scroll down to the end of the file and add the following lines:
   ```
   Match User sftpnode
   ForceCommand internal-sftp
   PasswordAuthentication yes
   ChrootDirectory /var/sftp
   PermitTunnel no
   AllowAgentForwarding no
   AllowTcpForwarding no
   X11Forwarding no
   ```

4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

5. Restart the SSH service to apply the new configuration:
   ```
   sudo service ssh restart
   ```

With these steps, you have set up an SFTP user named `sftpnode` with a strong password and configured the SSH server to restrict the user to SFTP access only, chrooted to the `/var/sftp` directory.

Please note that these instructions assume you have administrative privileges (`sudo`) on the Ubuntu server. Adjust the commands as needed based on your specific setup and requirements.
